MadwifiKarmaPatch
This describes the installation of Karma patched madwifi-ng drivers on Backtrack 4 Pre Final. It might also work on other Linux distributions.

I assume you have an updated version of BT4 Pre Final with the latest kernel installed. The wireless chipset I'm refering to is: AR5008E-3NX and the hardware a Asus EEE PC 901 But it should work for other hardware, too.

Installation - the easy way
The package your are about to download is the original tar ball from www.darkoperator.com with a minor modification to work on BT4 Pre Final

wget http://ubitack.googlecode.com/files/madwifi-ng_r4003-karma-BT4.tgz
tar xfvz madwifi-ng_r4003-karma-BT4.tgz
cd madwifi-ng_r4003-hal-0.10.5.6-Karma-Injection_BT4
make
./scripts/madwifi-unload
make install
depmod -ae
modprobe ath_pci
Installation - the almost easy way
If you prefer to use the none modified drivers and do the patching yourselves feel free:

wget http://www.darkoperator.com/tools-and-scripts/Madwifi-hal-Karma-Injection-Pached.tgz
tar xfvz Madwifi-hal-Karma-Injection-Pached.tgz
cd madwifi-hal-0.10.5.6-backup/
Now open one of the next file and modify line 2133

vi net80211/ieee80211_wireless.c
The following line:

struct ieee80211vap *vap = dev->priv;
should look like this:

struct ieee80211vap *vap = netdev_priv(dev);
Now proceed with the installation

./scripts/madwifi-unload
make
make install
depmod -ae
modprobe ath_pci
