The intention to write this tool was to automates some of the tasks I need on (wireless) penetration tests.
It aims to be a multi purpose tool for: 
    * Connect to different access points with different credentials with easy to use config files
    * Run an evil / rogue access point (Karma, Karmetasploit, ...)
    * Do a MitM attack
    * Sniff credentials (dsniff suite, sslstrip)
    * Hamster credentials (Wifizoo, Ferret, Hamster)
    * Test WEP encryption (Wepbuster)
    * Set up secure connections in hostile environments (SSH tunnel, OpenVPN, DNS Tunnel)
    * Install and update required software packages for the above tasks 

Written for the security disto Backtrack, heavily tested on BT4 Final and R1 in particular, also running on Ubuntu 9.10, but might work on others systems, too.
Please check http://code.google.com/p/ubitack/ frequently for updates.
