Usage instructions for ubitack

Introduction
Ubitack offers several pentest tools and combined attack methods like a sniffing wireless evil access point

Choose wireless interface
As most of the features require a wireless interface to work with you need to pick one right after the start of ubitack

Main menu
All the available methods and tools can be chosen from here.

If you are using a Atheros chipset I suggest you set the antenna diversity settings first.
Then IÂ´d perform a wireless site survey.
Or you start with an evil access point
Hint: You can refresh the output of the main menu at any time by pressing <CR>

Example: Evil Access Point
The script's strength is definitely the creation of an evil access point and its way to take care of all necessary settings.

Prerequisites for this example are: a working internet connection, an injection capable wifi interface, aircrack suite and sslstrip installed

After you picked your wireless interface proceed to the main menu. There look for the following line:

18)  Start  19)  Stop Evil Access Point (192.168.167.1 OFFLINE)
Simply type 18 and hit enter and answer the following questions.

Which channel do you want to use[1-14]/<CR> for random?: 6
Which MAC address do you want to use[00:11:22:33:44:55]/RANDOM/<CR> for no change?: RANDOM
Use [h]ostap or [a]irbase-ng [h/a]: a
Do you want to act as NAT [R]outer to the internet, use [K]armetasploit or use a web [P]roxy? R
Start sslstrip, TheMiddler or none [s/t/n]: s
After the script did its magic check the log output, hit <CR> and check the main menu for more information. To refresh the main menu just hit <CR> again.
